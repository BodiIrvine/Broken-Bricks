**1\. App Idea**  
We are doing the game game breakout remix. With a story mode, co’op / PvP, and an endless mode. We will travel through multiple worlds and levels. We will have achievements and permanent unlocks. For endless mode where after a level the balls will move faster until the user can't keep up. Co Op will be a battle where first to die loses..

**2\. Target Audience**  
Age (11 \- 17\) for who like puzzle, co’op and casual

**3\. Goals and Vision**  
We want a fun and casual  mobile game that has some replayability.
